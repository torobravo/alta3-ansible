# Using roles
Roles are prepackaged sets of tasks, variables, handlers, and other content designed to simplify and organize your automation work.

Just like collections, roles can be downloaded from Ansible Galaxy. For this lab, we’ll use the custom-made NASA API role we created earlier to interact with NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API.

1. Open Ansible Galaxy in your browser: Ansible Galaxy. Click on "Roles" in the left-hand navigation bar and search for a role that fits a need you might have. If you’re not sure what to look for, try searching for "nginx," "mysql," or "docker."

2. Find a role that looks interesting. If you want to try it, note the `ansible-galaxy install` command provided and use it to install the role.
